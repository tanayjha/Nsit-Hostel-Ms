Little help...

24
00:03:01,437 --> 00:03:05,800
Just... I have to keep
my hands on the wheel.

25
00:03:06,663 --> 00:03:07,663
Excuse me!

26
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:12,787
- Dopinder.
- Pool. Dead.

27
00:03:15,287 --> 00:03:18,163
- Nice!
- Smells good, no?

28
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,039
Not the daffodil
daydream. The girl.

29
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,740
Yes. Gita.
She is quite lovely.

30
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,579
She would have made me
a very agreeable wife.

31
00:03:26,688 --> 00:03:27,647
But...

32
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,539
Gita's heart has been
stolen by my cousin, Bandu.

33
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,139
He is as dishonorable
as he is attractive.

34
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,020
Dopinder,

35
00:03:38,028 --> 00:03:41,048
I'm starting to think there's a
reason I'm in this cab today.

36
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:43,018
Yes, sir, you called
for it, remember?

37
00:03:43,026 --> 00:03:45,048
No, my slender, brown friend.
Love...

38
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,067
is a beautiful thing.

39
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:51,247
When you find it, the whole world
tastes like daffodil daydream.

40
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,039
So you gotta hold
on to love. Tight!

41
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,240
And never let go. Don't make the
same mistakes I did, got it?

42
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:03,340
Or else the whole world tastes
like Mama June after hot yoga.

43
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,139
Sir, what does Miss
Mama June taste like?

44
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,289
Like two hobos fucking in
a shoe filled with piss.

45
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,247
I can go all day, Dopinder.
The point is it's bad.

46
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,540
Why the fancy
red suit, Mr. Pool?

47
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,108
Oh, that's because it's
Christmas day, Dopinder,

48
00:04:19,117 --> 00:04:21,148
and I'm after someone
on my naughty list.

49
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,886
I've been waiting, 1 year,
3 weeks, 6 days and...

50
00:04:24,894 --> 00:04:28,247
14 minutes to make him
fix what he did to me.

51
00:04:28,312 --> 00:04:31,105
And what did he do
to you, Mr. Pool?

52
00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:32,321
This shit.

53
00:04:34,312 --> 00:04:35,312
Boo!

54
00:04:55,312 --> 00:04:59,312
- They won't disappoint.
- They'd better not!

55
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:02,713
- What about next month's shipment?
- There won't be one.

56
00:05:03,473 --> 00:05:05,783
You're not the only
one with a war to win.

57
00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:08,512
That won't do.

58
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:15,012
See, we've had this small
disruption to our supply trade.

59
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:22,367
We'd appreciate your patience.

60
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:24,968
Okay...

61
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:26,894
We'll deliver in full
the following month.

62
00:05:30,793 --> 00:05:32,793
Pleasure doing
business with you.

63
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,793
Fucking mutant!

64
00:05:47,793 --> 00:05:50,793
Shit! I forgot my ammo bag!

65
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:55,293
- Shall we turn back?
- No time. Fuck it. I got this.

66
00:05:55,492 --> 00:05:59,793
9, 10, 11, 12 bullets.
Or bust. Right here!

67
00:06:01,793 --> 00:06:04,192
That's $27.50.

68
00:06:04,392 --> 00:06:08,293
I never carry a wallet while I'm
working. Ruins the lines of my suit.

69
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:11,466
- But how 'bout a crisp high-five?
- Okay.

70
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:12,882
Merry Christmas!

71
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:16,518
And a convivial Tuesday
and April to you too, Pool!

I know, right?

80

Whose balls did I have to fondle
to get my very own movie?

81
00:06:45,627 --> 00:06:46,701
I can't tell you,

82
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:50,435
but it does rhyme with "Pulverine".
And lemme tell you...

83
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:54,726
He's got a nice pair of
smooth criminals down under!

84
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:58,776
Anyway. I got places to be.
A face to fix. And, oh!

85
00:06:58,826 --> 00:07:01,026
Bad guys to kill.

86
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,726
Maximum effort.

87
00:07:17,726 --> 00:07:19,326
Cock shot!

88
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:29,726
Rich, Corinthian leather!

89
00:07:30,726 --> 00:07:33,326
I'm looking for Francis!

90
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:35,427
Have you seen this man?

91
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:47,226
Yanking, yanking!

92
00:08:18,726 --> 00:08:21,427
I've never said this,
but don't swallow.

93
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:46,326
Shit. Did I leave the stove on?

94
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,527
Now, breaking news.

95
00:09:05,726 --> 00:09:09,726
A multi-car collision turned shots fired
on the crosstown expressway this morning.

96
00:09:09,826 --> 00:09:11,946
Gridlock has kept
police from the scene.

97
00:09:11,955 --> 00:09:14,434
Residents are advised to
remain in their homes.

98
00:09:14,726 --> 00:09:17,726
The assailant appears to be
armed, dangerous, and wearing a...

99
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:20,726
Red suit. Deadpool.

100
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,927
Negasonic! Come.
We have mission.

101
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:26,626
Colossus, wait up.

102
00:09:26,726 --> 00:09:30,226
I've given Deadpool
every chance to join us.

103
00:09:30,427 --> 00:09:35,226
But he'd rather act like
a child. A heavily armed child.

104
00:09:35,427 --> 00:09:39,126
When will he grow up and see
benefits of becoming X-Man?

105
00:09:39,326 --> 00:09:41,326
Which benefits,
the matching unitards?

106
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:43,434
The house that blows
up every few years?

107
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:46,726
Please. House blowing
up builds character.

108
00:09:46,826 --> 00:09:52,126
You ate breakfast, yes? Breakfast
is most important meal of day.

109
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:56,427
Here. Protein bar.
Good for bones.

110
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:59,226
Deadpool may try
to break yours.

111
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,326
Hey!

112
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:42,826
Wait! You may be wondering
why the red suit.

113
00:10:43,027 --> 00:10:45,626
Well that's so bad guys
can't see me bleed.

114
00:10:45,726 --> 00:10:48,626
This guy's got the right idea.
He wore the brown pants.

115
00:10:50,726 --> 00:10:54,427
Fine! I only have 12 bullets, so
you're gonna have to share!

116
00:10:54,628 --> 00:10:56,223
Let's count 'em down!

117
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:21,623
Shit, motherfucker!

118
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,523
Ten! Shit.

119
00:11:23,722 --> 00:11:28,327
Nine! Fuck.
Eight. Shit-fuck!

120
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:33,322
Bad Deadpool.

121
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,722
Seven. Good Deadpool!

122
00:11:58,522 --> 00:12:00,522
Someone's not counting.

123
00:12:00,624 --> 00:12:01,726
Six!

124
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:29,726
Four...

125
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:32,726
Gotcha!

126
00:12:33,726 --> 00:12:36,226
Right up main street!

127
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:43,427
Three, two! Stupid!
Worth it.

128
00:13:08,726 --> 00:13:11,726
I'm touching myself tonight.

129
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:14,726
Francis! Francis!

130
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:21,326
What the shitbiscuit!
Where you at, Francis?

131
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,726
You're not Francis!

132
00:13:38,726 --> 00:13:41,726
Really? Rolling up the sleeves?

133
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:54,706
You're probably thinking, "my boyfriend
said this was a superhero movie

134
00:13:54,716 --> 00:13:58,726
but that guy in the red suit just turned
that other guy into a fucking kebab.

135
00:13:58,727 --> 00:14:02,927
Well, I may be super.
But I'm no hero.

136
00:14:03,726 --> 00:14:05,635
Anyhow, technically,
this is a murder.

137
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:08,335
But some of the best love
stories start with a murder.

138
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:12,576
And that's exactly what this is:
a love story. And to tell it right,

139
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:17,527
I gotta take you back to long before
I squeeze this ass into red spandex.

140
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:23,326
Look, would it help if I slow it down
for you? I didn't order the pizza.

141
00:14:23,527 --> 00:14:26,626
Is this 7348 Redledge Drive?

142
00:14:26,726 --> 00:14:27,818
Are you Mr. Merchant?

143
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:31,335
The Mr. Merchant who didn't
order the fucking pie!

144
00:14:31,826 --> 00:14:34,326
- Who placed the call?
- I did!

145
00:14:35,726 --> 00:14:41,326
Pineapple and olive?
Sweet and salty!

146
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:44,326
The fuck are you? The fuck
are you doing in my crib?

147
00:14:44,527 --> 00:14:47,927
- Is that bread crust? Don't move!
- God, I hope not.

148
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:51,726
Look, is this about that
poker game? I told Howie...

149
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,726
- Just take whatever you want.
- Thanks!

150
00:14:57,126 --> 00:15:00,927
Sir, before you do anything to him,
do you mind if I get a big tip?

151
00:15:02,726 --> 00:15:05,726
- Jeremy, is it? Wade Wilson.
- Yeah.

152
00:15:05,826 --> 00:15:09,427
That is a no go on
the tip-aroo, Jer.

153
00:15:09,527 --> 00:15:12,726
I'm not here for him.
I'm here for you.

154
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:16,431
I dodged a big-time
bullet on that one!

155
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,534
Not, out of the woods yet.

156
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:21,595
You need to seriously ease
up on the bedazzling.

157
00:15:21,604 --> 00:15:23,534
They're jeans, not a chandelier.

158
00:15:23,626 --> 00:15:26,024
Yes I'm keeping your wallet.
You did kind of give it to me.

159
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:30,527
- Just look, man, can I have my...
- I will shoot your fucking cat.

160
00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:32,927
I don't really know what that
means, I don't have a cat.

161
00:15:33,027 --> 00:15:35,726
Then whose kitty litter
did I just shit in?

162
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:40,027
Anywho...

163
00:15:40,326 --> 00:15:44,726
Tell me something. What situation
isn't improved by pizza?

164
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:49,326
Do you happen to know a Megan
Orflosky? Get that right? Orflovsky?

165
00:15:51,726 --> 00:15:54,427
'Cause she knows you. Jeremy...

166
00:15:54,726 --> 00:15:58,126
I belong to a group of guys who
take a dime to beat a fella down.

167
00:15:58,326 --> 00:16:02,927
And little Megan, she's not made of money,
but lucky for her, I got a soft spot.

168
00:16:03,726 --> 00:16:05,726
- I'm.....
- A stalker.

169
00:16:05,826 --> 00:16:10,726
Threats hurt, Jer. Though not
nearly as badly as serrated steel.

170
00:16:10,826 --> 00:16:16,726
- So keep away from Megan. Cool?
- Yes, sir.

171
00:16:16,826 --> 00:16:19,726
- And we're done.
- Wait, we are?

172
00:16:19,826 --> 00:16:23,527
Totally done. You
should've seen your face!

173
00:16:23,726 --> 00:16:25,655
I didn't know what to
do, I was so scared...

174
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:26,735
Soft spot, remember?

175
00:16:27,726 --> 00:16:31,952
Even look in her general direction again
and you will learn in the worst of ways

176
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:33,735
that I have some
hard spots, too.

177
00:16:34,726 --> 00:16:36,726
That came out wrong.

178
00:16:37,726 --> 00:16:39,726
Or did it?

179
00:16:51,726 --> 00:16:53,726
Megan.

180
00:16:55,726 --> 00:16:58,927
You've heard the last
of Jeremy. He's sorry.

181
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,726
No friggin' way.

182
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:08,727
Should've brought my roller blades.
Show these kids how it's done.

183
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:11,727
And that's why we do it.
But mostly the money.

184
00:17:11,926 --> 00:17:13,727
Hey. Think you can
fuck up my step dad?

185
00:17:13,926 --> 00:17:16,727
If I can give the guy a pavement
facial, it's 'cause he's earned it.

186
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:18,727
Hey, wait.

187
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:23,727
- You're my hero.
- No, no, no, no, no. That, I ain't.

188
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:30,527
Nope. Never will be.
- Fuck you, Wade.

189
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:33,727
I'm just a bad guy who gets
paid to fuck up worse guys.

190
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:39,727
Welcome to Sister Margaret's.
It's like a job fair for mercenaries.

191
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:42,054
Think of us as really
fucked up tooth fairies

192
00:17:42,063 --> 00:17:44,434
except we knock out the
teeth and take the cash.

193
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:48,493
You'd best hope we never see
your name on a gold card.

194
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:49,734
(Buck! Liefeld.)

195
00:17:49,926 --> 00:17:52,727
- Hey, Wade!
- Wade Wilson. Patron Saint of the Pitiful.

196
00:17:52,826 --> 00:17:55,727
- What can I do for you?
- I'd love a blowjob.

197
00:17:55,826 --> 00:18:00,027
- Oh, God, me too.
- The drink. With snuggle. But first...

198
00:18:00,727 --> 00:18:03,145
- Hey, I ain't taking
any babysitting money,

199
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:05,734
make sure that gets back to Miss...
- Orlovsky?

200
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:08,227
- You sure?
- Hmm.

201
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:10,200
For a merc, you're
pretty warm-blooded.

202
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:12,234
Bet you let the kid
off easy, too.

203
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:14,126
He's not a bad kid.

204
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,809
Just a little light stalking.

205
00:18:15,818 --> 00:18:19,742
I was way worse when I was his age,
travelling to exotic places...

206
00:18:19,826 --> 00:18:21,527
Baghdad, Mogadishu,
Jacksonville,

207
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:23,934
meeting new and exciting people.
And then..

208
00:18:24,027 --> 00:18:26,292
Killing them. Yeah, I've
seen your instagram.

209
00:18:26,301 --> 00:18:29,035
So what were special forces
doing in Jacksonville?

210
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:32,727
That's classified. They
have wonderful TGIFridays!

211
00:18:32,826 --> 00:18:36,727
Alright, kahlua, baileys
and whipped cream.

212
00:18:36,826 --> 00:18:38,727
I give you, a blowjob. I'm...

213
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,727
- Why do you make me make that?
- Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...

214
00:18:41,826 --> 00:18:46,027
Take that over there to Buck, please and
tell him it's from Booth. Little foreplay.

215
00:18:46,227 --> 00:18:48,221
Remind me what good
will come of this?

216
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,734
I don't take the shits,
I just disturb them.

217
00:18:51,727 --> 00:18:53,727
What you want?

218
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:59,727
- Cheers. To your health.
- Fuck you.

219
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:02,727
That's a new stool.

220
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:09,727
Stay the fuck down.

221
00:19:13,727 --> 00:19:15,826
Alright, move, move, move, move.

222
00:19:15,926 --> 00:19:16,926
Buck, go rest.

223
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:25,727
He's still breathing.

224
00:19:27,727 --> 00:19:31,727
Nobody wins today. Nice try, Wade.

225
00:19:31,826 --> 00:19:34,727
You got me. I picked Booth in
the dead pool. Who did you pick?

226
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:40,727
- You know, Wade, about that....
- No. You did not bet on me to die.

227
00:19:42,727 --> 00:19:44,088
You bet on me to die.

228
00:19:44,097 --> 00:19:47,535
Wow. Motherfucker, you're
the world's worst friend.

229
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:49,990
Well, joke's on you.
I'm living to 102.

230
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,234
And then die. At the
city of Detroit.

231
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:54,573
I'm sorry. I wanted
to win money.

232
00:19:54,582 --> 00:19:56,634
I never win anything.

233
00:19:56,727 --> 00:19:59,926
Whatever. Soldiers of
fortune, drink's on me!

234
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:01,035
Yeah!

235
00:20:01,727 --> 00:20:03,727
Domestic! Nothing imported.

236
00:20:05,727 --> 00:20:08,126
Woah, woah, woah. Baby...

237
00:20:08,727 --> 00:20:10,727
Are you sure you wanna
shoot your whole wad?

238
00:20:13,727 --> 00:20:15,727
Tight.

239
00:20:16,227 --> 00:20:18,227
- Vanessa.
- Wade.

240
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:21,727
What's a nice place like
you doing in a girl like this?

241
00:20:21,826 --> 00:20:23,727
I'd hit that.

242
00:20:24,727 --> 00:20:28,727
Buck, you'd best apologize
before... yeah. That.

243
00:20:28,826 --> 00:20:31,727
- Say the magic words, fat Gandalf.
- I'm sorry.

244
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:33,046
Breathe through the nose.

245
00:20:33,055 --> 00:20:35,734
I don't have a filter
between my brain and my...

246
00:20:35,826 --> 00:20:39,727
Okay, hey. Hakuna
his tatas, he's sorry!

247
00:20:39,826 --> 00:20:42,098
Get outta here. Go cast a spell.

248
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:44,734
Hey, hands off the merchandise.

249
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:49,727
Merchandise, huh. So you...

250
00:20:49,826 --> 00:20:52,727
- Fun fuzzies for money?
- Yup.

251
00:20:52,826 --> 00:20:53,848
Rough childhood?

252
00:20:53,857 --> 00:20:56,634
Rougher than yours.
Daddy left before I was born.

253
00:20:56,727 --> 00:20:59,727
Daddy left before I was conceived.

254
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:01,526
Ever had a cigarette
put out on your skin?

255
00:21:01,535 --> 00:21:02,734
Where else do you put one out?

256
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:05,527
- I was molested.
- Me, too. Uncle.

257
00:21:05,727 --> 00:21:07,727
Uncles. They took turns.

258
00:21:07,736 --> 00:21:09,775
I watched my own birthday
party through the keyhole

259
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:11,742
of a locked closet which
also happens to be my...

260
00:21:11,826 --> 00:21:15,727
Your bedroom. Lucky. I
slept in a dishwasher box.

261
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:17,267
You had a dishwasher.

262
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,894
I didn't even know sleep.

263
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:23,042
It was pretty much 24/7 ball kegs,
brownie mix and clown porn.

264
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:27,727
Who would do such a thing?

265
00:21:28,727 --> 00:21:32,727
Hopefully, you.
Later tonight?

266
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:42,727
What can I get for 275 dollars
and a yogurt rewards card?

267
00:21:42,826 --> 00:21:45,727
Baby, about 48 minutes of
whatever the fuck you want.

268
00:21:46,727 --> 00:21:49,727
And a low-fat dessert.

269
00:21:55,727 --> 00:21:58,727
Did she just put a gift
card in your mouth?

270
00:21:59,727 --> 00:22:02,727
It's time to put
balls in holes.

271
00:22:02,826 --> 00:22:05,727
- You said whatever I want.
- I get it.

272
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:10,161
You love ski ball. Apparently
more than you love vagina.

273
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,734
That's a tough call.

274
00:22:12,027 --> 00:22:15,124
I just wanna get to
know the real you.

275
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,192
Not the short-

276
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:19,643
shorted 2-dimensional sex
object peddled by Hollywood.

277
00:22:19,727 --> 00:22:21,727
Balls in holes.

278
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:25,727
- Prepare to lose tragically.
- Bring it, big man.

279
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:37,726
A limited edition Voltron: Defender
of the Universe ring, por favor.

280
00:22:37,727 --> 00:22:39,727
Okay. Here you go.

281
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:42,727
I had this sucker for a while.

282
00:22:42,826 --> 00:22:45,227
- And I will take the pencil eraser.
- Okay.

283
00:22:45,727 --> 00:22:49,480
You are now the proud
protector of the planet Arus.

284
00:22:49,489 --> 00:22:52,734
And you, can erase stuff.
Written in pencil.

285
00:22:52,826 --> 00:22:53,906
Milady.

286
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:57,835
I hate to break it to you,
but your 48 minutes are up.

287
00:22:58,227 --> 00:23:00,727
How many more minutes
could I get for this?

288
00:23:00,826 --> 00:23:05,727
FYI, 5 mini lion bots come
together to form 1 superbot.

289
00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:08,378
5 mini lion bots? 3 minutes.

290
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:13,035
Deal. What do we do with
the remaining 2:37?

291
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:14,227
Cuddle?

292
00:23:18,727 --> 00:23:22,727
- How long can we keep this up?
- All year?

293
00:23:31,727 --> 00:23:34,727
Happy Valentines' Day.

294
00:23:40,727 --> 00:23:44,727
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Year of the Dog.

295
00:23:49,727 --> 00:23:54,727
Relax... and happy
International Women's Day.

296
00:24:03,727 --> 00:24:05,727
Happy Lenten.

297
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:14,727
- Wade!
- Sorry. Happy Halloween!

298
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:25,727
Happy Thanksgiving.

299
00:24:26,727 --> 00:24:28,727
I love you.

300
00:24:31,727 --> 00:24:35,727
If your left leg is Thanksgiving,
and your right leg is Christmas...

301
00:24:36,326 --> 00:24:39,727
Can I visit you
between the holidays?

302
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:42,727
That sweater is terrible!

303
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:45,727
But red looks good on you.

304
00:24:45,826 --> 00:24:48,727
Red's your color. Mine's like
the bloodshot in your eyes.

305
00:24:49,126 --> 00:24:51,027
- Listen. I've been thinking.
- Really?

306
00:24:52,727 --> 00:24:55,727
- 'Bout why we're so good together.
- Why is that?

307
00:24:56,727 --> 00:25:00,727
Your crazy matches
my crazy. Bigtime.

308
00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:05,727
And we're like 2 jigsaw
pieces. Weird curvy edges?

309
00:25:05,826 --> 00:25:08,946
You put them together and you
can see the picture on top.

310
00:25:08,955 --> 00:25:10,035
Right.

311
00:25:10,727 --> 00:25:14,727
Wade... There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.

312
00:25:14,826 --> 00:25:17,727
But only because you haven't
gotten around to asking me.

313
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:20,727
Will you...

314
00:25:21,727 --> 00:25:24,727
- Stick it up my...
- ...Marry me?

315
00:25:25,727 --> 00:25:27,727
Uh... Jinx?

316
00:25:29,727 --> 00:25:31,727
- Where were you hiding that?
- Nowhere.

317
00:25:31,826 --> 00:25:35,126
- They said 1-month salary, so...
- You mean...

318
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:37,727
- I do.
- That's my line.

319
00:25:40,727 --> 00:25:44,426
- I love you, Wade Wilson.
- You're supposed to... So that's a...

320
00:25:44,727 --> 00:25:46,727
- Yes!
- Woo! Yes!

321
00:25:49,727 --> 00:25:51,727
I feel just like a little girl!

322
00:25:56,727 --> 00:25:59,430
What if I just held
on and never let go?

323
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:02,734
Just ride the bitch's
back like Yoda on Luke.

324
00:26:02,826 --> 00:26:06,727
- Star Wars jokes!
- Empire!

325
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:10,727
Jesus Christ, it's like I
made you in a computer!

326
00:26:16,727 --> 00:26:18,727
Perfect.

327
00:26:22,727 --> 00:26:25,727
Pee break. Shake it, yeah.

328
00:26:30,727 --> 00:26:32,727
Here's the thing:

329
00:26:32,826 --> 00:26:34,992
Life is an endless
series of train wrecks

330
00:26:35,001 --> 00:26:37,734
with only brief commercial-like
breaks of happiness.

331
00:26:38,727 --> 00:26:42,727
This had been the
ultimate commercial break.

332
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:47,727
Which meant it was time to return,
to our regularly scheduled programme.

333
00:26:48,027 --> 00:26:50,727
- What the fu.....
- Oh my God, Wade!

334
00:26:56,727 --> 00:27:01,727
You're clowning. You're
not clowning. I sense clowns.

335
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:05,727
People react to news of late-
stage cancer differently.

336
00:27:05,826 --> 00:27:08,417
There are certainly
options we can look into.

337
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,734
New drugs are being
developed every day.

338
00:27:13,727 --> 00:27:18,727
So what do we do? Surely,
there is something we can do.

339
00:27:18,826 --> 00:27:21,583
My Uncle Ivan was diagnosed
with Thyroid cancer

340
00:27:21,592 --> 00:27:25,035
and there were all these
experimental drugs from Germany...

341
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:28,727
Vanessa's already working on plan
A, B, all the way through Z.

342
00:27:29,727 --> 00:27:32,974
Me? I'm memorizing the
details of her face.

343
00:27:32,983 --> 00:27:35,934
Like it's the first
time I'm seeing it.

344
00:27:36,326 --> 00:27:38,727
- Or the last...
- Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wilson?

345
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:43,309
Take your time to process this.

346
00:27:43,318 --> 00:27:46,734
It's important not
to do anything rash.

347
00:27:57,727 --> 00:28:02,727
Now, if I were a 200 pound sack of assholes
named Francis, where would I hide?

348
00:28:28,727 --> 00:28:32,761
"A hush falls over the crowd
as rookie sensation Wade W.

349
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:36,734
Wilson out of Regina,
Saskatchewan, lines up the shot."

350
00:28:37,727 --> 00:28:39,727
"His form looks good."

351
00:28:41,727 --> 00:28:46,227
"And that's why Regina
rhymes with fun."

352
00:28:46,426 --> 00:28:51,027
"Ladies and gentlemen, what you're
witnessing is sweet, dick-kicking revenge!"

353
00:28:51,727 --> 00:28:55,727
"Giving him the business! Incoming!"

354
00:28:55,826 --> 00:28:59,727
"This is taking unsportsman-like
conduct to a whole new level!"

355
00:29:04,727 --> 00:29:08,527
Looking good, Francis. Well-rested.
Like you've been pitching, not catching.

356
00:29:08,727 --> 00:29:11,727
Ringing any bells? No?

357
00:29:15,727 --> 00:29:17,727
How 'bout now?

358
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,727
Wade fucking Wilson.

359
00:29:25,727 --> 00:29:27,193
Well, hello, gorgeous.

360
00:29:27,202 --> 00:29:30,734
Yeah, like I got bit by
a radioactive Shar Pei.

361
00:29:30,826 --> 00:29:35,724
And whose fault is that, huh, Francis? Time
to undo what you did to this butter face.

362
00:29:35,726 --> 00:29:36,903
You should thank me.

363
00:29:36,912 --> 00:29:40,734
Apparently, I've made you immortal.
I'm actually quite jealous.

364
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:44,227
Yeah, but this ain't a
life worth living, is it? Now...

365
00:29:44,727 --> 00:29:49,727
I'm about to do to you what Limp
Bizkit did to music in the late 90's.

366
00:29:50,727 --> 00:29:52,727
Dad?

367
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:59,727
I think we can all agree that shit just
went sideways in the most colossal way.

368
00:30:00,727 --> 00:30:03,326
Well, maybe not the most.

369
00:30:04,326 --> 00:30:07,227
Now this, is my
most prized possession.

370
00:30:07,727 --> 00:30:11,227
- Wham?
- No, no, no, no. WHAM!

371
00:30:11,486 --> 00:30:14,727
Make It Big is the album that George and
Andy earned the exclamation point.

372
00:30:14,826 --> 00:30:18,727
So, am I supposed to just
smile and wave you out the door?

373
00:30:18,826 --> 00:30:21,727
Think of it like spring cleaning.
Only if spring was death.

374
00:30:21,826 --> 00:30:25,727
God, if I had a nickel for everytime I
spanked at the Bernadette Peters.

375
00:30:26,727 --> 00:30:29,759
Sounds like you have.
Bernadette is not going...

376
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:32,750
anywhere, because you're
not going anywhere.

377
00:30:33,394 --> 00:30:34,693
- Drink.
- You're right.

378
00:30:34,894 --> 00:30:38,394
Cancer's only in my liver, lungs, prostate
and brain. All things I can live without.

379
00:30:40,394 --> 00:30:42,040
You belong here at home.

380
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:46,301
Surrounded by your Voltron, and
your Bernadette and your me.

381
00:30:46,394 --> 00:30:51,394
Listen, we both know
that cancer is a shit show.

382
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,538
Like a jack-off, Smirnoff,

383
00:30:53,547 --> 00:30:58,807
opening for the spin doctors at
the Iowa state fair shit show.

384
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:05,599
And under no circumstances
will I take you, to that show.

385
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:10,599
I want you to remember me.
Not the "ghost of Christmas" me.

386
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,299
I wanna remember us!

387
00:31:12,308 --> 00:31:13,588
I swear to God,

388
00:31:13,597 --> 00:31:17,692
I'll find you in the next life and boom
box Careless Whisper outside your window.

389
00:31:17,701 --> 00:31:18,723
WHAM!

390
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:25,400
No one is boom
boxing shit. Okay?

391
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,400
We can fight this.

392
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,400
Wease.

393
00:32:02,409 --> 00:32:04,861
You look like you need a
blowjob and a shower.

394
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:07,215
Little courtesy calls
for the latter, first.

395
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:09,117
How about three shots of patron.

396
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:11,708
Or, how about,
Triticum aestivum?

397
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,221
Wheatgrass. Excellent
for the immune system.

398
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,208
Jesus Christ, you
sound like Vanessa.

399
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:17,326
Here, check it out.

400
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:20,307
She's sending away for all these
colorful clinic brochures.

401
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,299
I'm sure they're
all FDA approved.

402
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,566
Chechnya? Isn't that where
you go to get cancer?

403
00:32:26,575 --> 00:32:28,907
We got China and Central Mexico.

404
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:31,619
You know how they say
cancer in Spanish?

405
00:32:31,628 --> 00:32:32,807
No.

406
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,200
- "El cancer."
- I could've guessed that.

407
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,565
Look how happy you look here.

408
00:32:38,574 --> 00:32:41,208
You mind if I keep this, put
it up, so I can remember?

409
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:42,692
When you looked alive.

410
00:32:42,701 --> 00:32:45,414
At least now I'm gonna
win the dead pool.

411
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:48,208
Now that you'll die,
tragically, of cancer.

412
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,700
I got it, thanks.

413
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,200
That guy over there came in looking
for you. Real grim reaper type.

414
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,200
I don't know. Might
further the plot.

415
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:06,200
- Booth.
- Wade.

416
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,700
Mr. Wilson.

417
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:14,333
How can I help you, besides

418
00:33:14,342 --> 00:33:16,615
luring children into a panel van?

419
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,106
I understand you've recently been
diagnosed with terminal cancer.

420
00:33:19,115 --> 00:33:20,208
Stalker alert!

421
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:22,451
It's my job. Recruitment.

422
00:33:22,661 --> 00:33:26,016
I'm sorry you've had
such a tough go.

423
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,778
But you're a fighter.

424
00:33:27,987 --> 00:33:31,134
Special Forces. 41 confirmed kills.

425
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:35,307
1 every 7 weeks. Same rate
most folks get a haircut.

426
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,833
This should wash the taste down.

427
00:33:37,842 --> 00:33:40,708
It's tough to forget
being so impressive.

428
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,019
And now you spend your days
sticking up for the little people.

429
00:33:45,127 --> 00:33:47,008
People change. What do you want?

430
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,900
I represent an organization
that may be able to help.

431
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:56,599
What if I told you we
can cure your cancer?

432
00:33:56,599 --> 00:34:00,849
And what's more, give you
abilities most men only dream of.

433
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,500
I'd say that you sound like
an infomercial. But...

434
00:34:06,673 --> 00:34:09,773
Not a good one, like
Slapchop, more Shakeweighty.

435
00:34:09,974 --> 00:34:14,974
The world needs extraordinary soldiers.
We won't just make you better.

436
00:34:14,974 --> 00:34:17,773
We will make you
better than better.

437
00:34:19,673 --> 00:34:20,949
A superhero.

438
00:34:20,974 --> 00:34:23,481
Look, Agent Smith,

439
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:26,005
I tried the hero business
and it left a mark.

440
00:34:26,074 --> 00:34:28,974
But if I ever hit fuck-
it, I'll look you up.

441
00:34:29,974 --> 00:34:31,773
Oh. Shit.

442
00:34:31,974 --> 00:34:35,974
We're within 500 yards of the school.
So you may wanna, you know...

443
00:34:38,974 --> 00:34:40,974
His drink's on him.

444
00:34:45,974 --> 00:34:47,974
What'd he say?

445
00:35:10,594 --> 00:35:12,012
Hey, what's going on?

446
00:35:13,106 --> 00:35:17,706
Hey, sorry. I had a
Liam Neeson nightmare.

447
00:35:18,706 --> 00:35:22,007
I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter
and he just wasn't having it.

448
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:34,007
They made 3 of those movies.

449
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:38,007
At some point, you'd have to
wonder if he's just a bad parent.

450
00:35:52,007 --> 00:35:55,306
The worst part about cancer
isn't what it does to you.

451
00:35:56,007 --> 00:35:58,007
But what it does to
the people you love.

452
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:02,543
Who knew if this guy
could save my life?

453
00:36:02,552 --> 00:36:06,014
But I knew there's only one
way that I could save hers.

454
00:36:09,007 --> 00:36:11,597
Isn't that what superheroes do?

455
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,400
Okay. Let's pro/con
this superhero thing.

456
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,711
Pro: they pull down
a gaggle of ass,

457
00:36:32,721 --> 00:36:35,009
local dry cleaning discounts,
lucrative film deals,

458
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:38,101
both origin stories and larger,
ensemble team movies.

459
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:41,201
Con: they're all lame-
ass teacher's pets!

460
00:36:41,202 --> 00:36:43,197
You know I can hear you.

461
00:36:43,206 --> 00:36:46,309
Wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to them.

462
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,704
Stay right here.

463
00:36:47,713 --> 00:36:50,800
You've been warned
before, Deadpool.

464
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,353
This is a shameful and
reckless use of your powers.

465
00:36:54,362 --> 00:36:56,398
You will both be coming with us.

466
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,920
Look Colossus, I don't have time for the
goody two-tissues bullshit right now.

467
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:02,608
And you are?

468
00:37:03,701 --> 00:37:05,701
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

469
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,300
Negasonic Teenage...
What the shit?!

470
00:37:09,501 --> 00:37:11,702
That's the coolest name ever!

471
00:37:12,701 --> 00:37:16,701
- So what, you're like his sidekick?
- No. Trainee.

472
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,059
Let me guess, X-Men left you
behind on what, shit detail?

473
00:37:21,068 --> 00:37:22,608
What does that make you?

474
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:25,900
Pretending you're not here, Negasonic
Teenage Warhead. Can we trade names?

475
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,798
- Can we go?
- "Look! I'm a teenage girl!"

476
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,730
"I'd rather be anywhere than here.

477
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:36,065
I'm all about long, sullen silences,
followed by mean comments,

478
00:37:36,074 --> 00:37:38,016
followed by more silences."

479
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,894
So what's it gonna be? huh?

480
00:37:39,903 --> 00:37:43,708
Long, sullen silence?
Or mean comment? Go on.

481
00:37:45,701 --> 00:37:47,286
You got me in a box here.

482
00:37:47,295 --> 00:37:51,509
We can't allow this, Deadpool.
Please, come quietly.

483
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,701
- You big, chrome cockgobbler!
- That's not nice.

484
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,701
You really got to fuck
this up for me? Trust me...

485
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:03,701
That wheezing bag of dick-tits
has it coming! He's pure evil!

486
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,701
Besides, nobody's getting hurt.

487
00:38:12,701 --> 00:38:15,400
That guy was already
up there when I got here.

488
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,818
Wade, you are better than this.

489
00:38:17,827 --> 00:38:21,034
Join us, use your
powers for good.

490
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,864
- Heads up!
- Be a superhero.

491
00:38:22,873 --> 00:38:27,108
- Listen! The day I decide to be
a crime-fighting shit-swizzler,

492
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:29,226
who rooms with a bunch
of other little whiners,

493
00:38:29,235 --> 00:38:31,250
at the Neverland Mansion
of some creepy,

494
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:34,925
old, bald, heaven's gate
looking motherfucker,

495
00:38:35,001 --> 00:38:36,099
on that day!,

496
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:39,097
I'll send your shiny, happy
ass a friend request.

497
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:41,809
But until then, I'm gonna
do what I came here to do.

498
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,498
Either that, or slap
the bitch out of you!

499
00:38:44,507 --> 00:38:45,820
- Wade...
- Hey.

500
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:47,909
- Zip it, Sinead!
- Hey, Douchepool!

501
00:38:48,501 --> 00:38:50,701
And I hope you're watching...

502
00:38:53,701 --> 00:38:55,701
Quite unfortunate.

503
00:38:58,701 --> 00:39:01,701
That does it!

504
00:39:04,701 --> 00:39:06,701
Canada!

505
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:11,701
- That's not good. Cock shot!
- Wade, please.

506
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:15,701
Oh, your poor wife!

507
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,701
You really should stop.

508
00:39:20,001 --> 00:39:23,101
All the dinosaurs
feared the T-Rex.

509
00:39:26,701 --> 00:39:29,251
I promise this gets
worse for you, big boy!

510
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,708
This is embarassing.

511
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:33,701
Please. Stay down.

512
00:39:34,701 --> 00:39:37,400
Did you ever hear of the one-legged
man in the ass-kicking contest?

513
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:38,596
Do you have 'off' switch?

514
00:39:38,605 --> 00:39:41,509
Yeah, it's right next to the prostate.
Or is that the 'on' switch?

515
00:39:41,701 --> 00:39:43,001
Enough!

516
00:39:51,701 --> 00:39:53,701
Let us go talk to the Professor.

517
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:59,300
McAvoy or Stewart? These
timelines are so confusing...

518
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:05,101
- Dead or alive, you're coming with me!
- You will recover, Wade. You always do.

519
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:13,701
Did you ever see "127 Hours"?
Spoiler alert!

520
00:40:17,701 --> 00:40:20,701
Oh my God. Nasty.

521
00:40:22,701 --> 00:40:28,701
Oh, there's the money shot, baby. Are
you there, God? It's me, Margaret.

522
00:40:38,701 --> 00:40:41,101
Rock, meet bottom.

523
00:40:41,701 --> 00:40:44,599
When life ends up
breathtakingly fucked,

524
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:48,708
you can generally trace it
back to one big, bad decision.

525
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,701
The one that sent you
down the road to Shitsburg.

526
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,701
This, well, this was mine.

527
00:40:55,701 --> 00:41:01,701
Mr. Wilson. Nothing warms my heart
more than a change of someone else's.

528
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:05,701
You've finally hit fuck-it.

529
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,378
Just promise you'll do right by me.

530
00:41:08,387 --> 00:41:10,809
So I can do right by someone else.

531
00:41:10,818 --> 00:41:12,016
Of course.

532
00:41:12,701 --> 00:41:17,701
And please don't make the
super-suit green. Or animated!

533
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:42,701
This place seems sanitary.
My first request is warmer hands.

534
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,701
And Jesus! A warmer table.

535
00:41:47,701 --> 00:41:50,833
You should really come up
with a safe word, fellas.

536
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,708
I'm thinking 'pork and beans'.

537
00:41:55,175 --> 00:41:57,175
Easy!

538
00:41:59,775 --> 00:42:01,617
Aren't you a little strong for a lady?

539
00:42:02,594 --> 00:42:05,594
I'm calling Wang.

540
00:42:07,594 --> 00:42:12,594
What's up with the matches?
Oral fixation? Or just a big Stallone fan?

541
00:42:13,594 --> 00:42:16,007
Patience, Angel.
All in good time.

542
00:42:16,016 --> 00:42:19,601
Are you here for the turn
down service or what?

543
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:21,913
We have another talker.

544
00:42:21,922 --> 00:42:24,447
I'm just excited about my
first day at superhero camp.

545
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:26,554
Shut the fuck up.

546
00:42:29,594 --> 00:42:34,594
Mr. Wilson, my name's
Ajax. I manage this workshop.

547
00:42:35,695 --> 00:42:38,592
All of my welcome speeches used
to be filled with euphemisms like,

548
00:42:38,594 --> 00:42:42,594
"this may hurt a little," or
"this might cause you some discomfort."

549
00:42:42,695 --> 00:42:44,135
But I'm going blunt.

550
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:47,594
This workshop is not a
government-led program.

551
00:42:47,594 --> 00:42:50,445
It's a private institution that
turns reclamation projects

552
00:42:50,454 --> 00:42:51,902
like yourself into men of....

553
00:42:52,594 --> 00:42:55,594
Extraordinary abilities.

554
00:42:56,594 --> 00:43:00,594
But if you think superhuman
powers are acquired painlessly...

555
00:43:00,603 --> 00:43:01,702
Wrong.

556
00:43:02,094 --> 00:43:03,594
I'm injecting you with a serum

557
00:43:03,603 --> 00:43:06,302
that activates any mutant
genes lurking in your DNA.

558
00:43:06,494 --> 00:43:11,594
For it to work, we need to
subject you to extreme stress.

559
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:19,594
You've heard the whole, "make an
omelet, break some eggs" bit, I hope.

560
00:43:19,993 --> 00:43:24,593
I'm about to hurt you, Wade. I was
a patient here once myself, you know.

561
00:43:25,593 --> 00:43:30,596
The treatment affects everyone differently.
It made Angel inhumanly strong.

562
00:43:31,595 --> 00:43:34,469
In my case, it
enhanced my reflexes,

563
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:38,902
also scorched my nerve endings
so I no longer feel pain.

564
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:44,194
And in fact, I no
longer feel anything.

565
00:43:53,596 --> 00:43:57,592
Thank... thank you! You
have something in your teeth.

566
00:43:58,596 --> 00:44:03,594
Right in the middle there, just...
Nugget of romaine lettuce or something.

567
00:44:05,594 --> 00:44:07,596
It's been bothering
me for a long time.

568
00:44:09,594 --> 00:44:12,536
Made you look. Hey, is
Ajax your actual name,

569
00:44:12,545 --> 00:44:15,103
because it sounds
suspiciously made up.

570
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:22,795
What is it really? Kevin? Bruce? Scott?
Mitch? Rickster? Is it Basil Fawlty?

571
00:44:22,903 --> 00:44:27,494
Joke away. One thing that never survives
this place is a sense of humor.

572
00:44:27,594 --> 00:44:30,594
- We'll see about that.
- I suppose we will.

573
00:44:31,594 --> 00:44:32,994
He's all yours.

574
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:38,603
C'mon. You're gonna leave me all alone
here with less angry Rosie O'Donnell?

575
00:44:42,594 --> 00:44:44,715
This is how it's going to work.

576
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:48,043
Adrenaline acts as a
catalyst for the serum, so

577
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:50,610
we're gonna have to
make you suffer.

578
00:44:51,594 --> 00:44:56,101
If you're lucky, your mutant genes
will activate and manifest in a

579
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,103
spectacular fashion.

580
00:45:01,594 --> 00:45:04,594
If not, well, we'll have
to keep on hurting you.

581
00:45:05,594 --> 00:45:09,594
In new and different ways,
each more painful than the last.

582
00:45:11,594 --> 00:45:14,594
Until you finally mutate...

583
00:45:15,594 --> 00:45:17,545
or die.

584
00:45:23,594 --> 00:45:25,480
You mean like a bucket list?

585
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:30,603
Like a fuck it list, I'd like to
light a spiff off the Olympic torch.

586
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:33,195
Acid to me, right after.

587
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:39,594
Let's not forget: naked tandem base-jumping
with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs.

588
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,594
Anything on my bucket list
would involve public nudity.

589
00:45:43,594 --> 00:45:46,594
Finally, giving Meredith
Baxter Birney a dutch oven.

590
00:45:46,695 --> 00:45:50,195
No, receiving a dutch oven
from Meredith Baxter Birney.

591
00:45:53,594 --> 00:45:57,594
Making banana
pancakes... For my kids...

592
00:46:00,994 --> 00:46:03,594
Vanessa...

593
00:46:06,594 --> 00:46:09,594
I wanna see Vanessa.

594
00:46:09,695 --> 00:46:13,594
Oh, lovely. I don't know about
anyone else but, I'm touched.

595
00:46:13,695 --> 00:46:15,494
We're just joking.

596
00:46:15,503 --> 00:46:20,603
No, no. It's okay. I
encourage distractions.

597
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:23,592
Wouldn't want you giving
up on us now, would we?

598
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:27,594
Hey, don't take any shit from him,
Cunningham. How tough can he be...

599
00:46:28,594 --> 00:46:32,594
- ... with a name like Francis?
- Francis?

600
00:46:33,594 --> 00:46:38,594
It's his legal name. He
got Ajax from a dish soap.

601
00:46:40,594 --> 00:46:45,594
F-R-A-N-C-I... oops!

602
00:46:48,295 --> 00:46:51,594
Snagged the dry cleaning
tag off your lab coat.

603
00:46:51,695 --> 00:46:55,594
FYI, I can probably get
you a superhero discount.

604
00:46:55,695 --> 00:46:59,594
- You are so relentlessly annoying.
- Thanks. Never heard that before.

605
00:46:59,695 --> 00:47:02,635
Why don't you do us all a
favor and shut the fuck up?

606
00:47:02,643 --> 00:47:04,603
Or I'll sew your
pretty mouth shut.

607
00:47:04,695 --> 00:47:08,494
Oh, I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

608
00:47:08,594 --> 00:47:11,710
See, here's the problem with
round-the-clock torture,

609
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:14,603
it's that you can't really
step it up from there.

610
00:47:16,594 --> 00:47:19,594
Is that what you think?

611
00:47:24,594 --> 00:47:29,295
If this doesn't unlock your
mutation, then, well, nothing will.

612
00:47:29,594 --> 00:47:32,900
What we're gonna do is lower the
oxygen concentration in the air

613
00:47:32,909 --> 00:47:35,603
to the exact point you feel
like you're suffocating.

614
00:47:35,695 --> 00:47:39,764
If your brain wave's slow meaning
you're about to pass out,

615
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,603
then we'll turn up the O2.

616
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:45,262
If your heart rate slows meaning
you're able to catch your breath,

617
00:47:45,271 --> 00:47:46,603
we'll turn it back down.

618
00:47:47,594 --> 00:47:51,594
And that's where we'll
leave you. Right there.

619
00:47:52,594 --> 00:47:56,594
- I thought you guys were dicks before...
- You know the funniest part of this?

620
00:47:57,594 --> 00:48:00,594
You still think we're
making you a superhero.

621
00:48:00,695 --> 00:48:07,394
You? A dishonorable discharge?
Hip deep in hookers?

622
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:12,594
You're nothing. A little secret, Wade...

623
00:48:12,695 --> 00:48:16,594
This workshop doesn't make
superheroes, we make superslaves.

624
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:22,594
We're gonna fit you with a control collar
and auction you off to the highest bidder.

625
00:48:22,695 --> 00:48:24,802
And that's what they'll
have you doing.

626
00:48:24,811 --> 00:48:27,603
Terrorizing citizens, putting
down freedom fighters.

627
00:48:29,594 --> 00:48:32,594
Maybe just mow
the occasional lawn.

628
00:48:33,594 --> 00:48:35,594
What the fuck is wrong with you?

629
00:48:40,594 --> 00:48:46,295
You're never going home after
this. Now there's a brave face.

630
00:48:46,594 --> 00:48:49,594
Wait, wait, wait...

631
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:55,594
Seriously, you actually have
something in your teeth now.

632
00:48:56,594 --> 00:49:02,594
- Enjoy your weekend.
- Weekend? Back up, weekend?

633
00:49:43,594 --> 00:49:48,594
Did I say this was a love
story? No. It's a horror movie.

634
00:50:04,594 --> 00:50:09,594
Fucking hell! Looks like someone
lost a shot at homecoming king.

635
00:50:09,695 --> 00:50:11,112
What have you done to me?

636
00:50:11,121 --> 00:50:15,603
I've mainly raised your stress levels
high enough to trigger a mutation.

637
00:50:15,695 --> 00:50:20,594
- You sadistic fuck!
- I've cured you, Wade.

638
00:50:20,695 --> 00:50:23,543
Now your mutated cells
can heal anything.

639
00:50:23,552 --> 00:50:26,603
Striking your cancer as
fast as it can form.

640
00:50:27,594 --> 00:50:32,594
Yeah, I've seen some other side
effects before... I could cure them.

641
00:50:35,594 --> 00:50:37,594
But where's the fun in that?

642
00:50:39,594 --> 00:50:42,594
Now I'm gonna shut
you in again, Wade.

643
00:50:44,085 --> 00:50:47,594
Not because I need to.

644
00:50:50,594 --> 00:50:52,594
Because I want to.

645
00:51:06,594 --> 00:51:09,594
Farewell. Go ahead.

646
00:51:11,594 --> 00:51:14,594
Ugh. You smell like shit.

647
00:51:17,594 --> 00:51:21,594
- Motherfucker...
- That's alright, it's alright...

648
00:51:21,695 --> 00:51:28,594
I think we have earned that one.
You take off. Go on, off you go.

649
00:51:39,594 --> 00:51:41,594
Quick question:

650
00:51:43,594 --> 00:51:45,594
What's my name?

651
00:51:50,594 --> 00:51:53,594
Didn't think so.

652
00:51:54,594 --> 00:51:57,594
Sorry, Francis. My lips are sealed.

653
00:53:53,155 --> 00:53:57,594
You don't wanna kill me. I'm the
only one who can fix your ugly mug!

654
00:54:53,594 --> 00:54:55,594
What's my name?

655
00:55:01,594 --> 00:55:03,594
Wade...

656
00:56:09,594 --> 00:56:17,594
I didn't just get the cure to el cancer...
I got the cure to el everything.

657
00:56:20,594 --> 00:56:25,594
But there was only one
thing that really mattered.

658
00:57:46,594 --> 00:57:50,295
No way. I'm not making
her life as ugly as mine.

659
00:57:50,494 --> 00:57:55,594
- Come on, Wade, it can't be that bad.
- Bullshit! I'm a monster inside now.

660
00:57:55,695 --> 00:57:59,295
- I belong in a fucking circus.
- Wade, Vanessa loves you.

661
00:57:59,494 --> 00:58:02,594
- She doesn't care what you... Oh!
- Do you like what you see?

662
00:58:02,695 --> 00:58:09,394
No. You look like an avocado had sex
with an older, more disgusting avocado.

663
00:58:09,594 --> 00:58:11,519
Not gently. He was hate-fucking.

664
00:58:11,528 --> 00:58:14,445
There was something wrong
with the relationship

665
00:58:14,454 --> 00:58:17,610
and that was their only
catharsis without violence.

666
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:21,972
And the only guy who can fix this
fugly mug is the British shitstick

667
00:58:21,981 --> 00:58:25,202
who ran the mutant factory.
And he's gone... Poof!

668
00:58:25,394 --> 00:58:26,947
You gotta do something
to remedy this.

669
00:58:26,956 --> 00:58:29,103
'Cause as of now, you only
have one course of action:

670
00:58:29,594 --> 00:58:33,195
- Damn straight. Find Francis.
- Star in horror films.

671
00:58:33,394 --> 00:58:36,394
- What?
- Star in your own horror films.

672
00:58:36,494 --> 00:58:40,094
'Cause you look like Freddy Krueger face-
fucked a topographical map of Utah.

673
00:58:40,994 --> 00:58:42,394
Here's what I'm
actually gonna do:

674
00:58:42,494 --> 00:58:45,731
I'm gonna work thru his crew
until somebody gives up Francis,

675
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:49,603
force him to fix this, put a bullet
in his skull, and fuck the brainhole.

676
00:58:49,695 --> 00:58:52,594
I don't wanna see that,
or think of it again. But,

677
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,014
the douchebag does think
you're dead, right?

678
00:58:55,023 --> 00:58:56,023
Yeah.

679
00:58:56,094 --> 00:58:58,224
That's good. You should
keep it that way.

680
00:58:58,233 --> 00:58:59,695
What, like, wear a mask?

681
00:58:59,695 --> 00:59:06,594
Yes, a very thick mask. All the
time. I'm sorry, you're haunting.

682
00:59:06,695 --> 00:59:10,295
- Your face is the stuff of nightmares.
- Like a testicle with teeth.

683
00:59:10,394 --> 00:59:16,594
You will die alone. I mean if you
could die. Ideally. For others' sake.

684
00:59:16,695 --> 00:59:17,675
That'll do.

685
00:59:17,684 --> 00:59:21,603
What you need now is a suit and a
nickname, like Wade the Wisecracker...

686
00:59:21,695 --> 00:59:27,215
or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie.
Oh, shit.

687
00:59:27,224 --> 00:59:28,603
What?

688
00:59:29,594 --> 00:59:33,594
I put all my money on you, and now I just
realized I'm never gonna win the....

689
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:34,702
Deadpool...

690
00:59:37,594 --> 00:59:40,594
Captain Deadpool.

691
00:59:41,594 --> 00:59:44,594
No. Just-just Deadpool. Yeah.

692
00:59:44,695 --> 00:59:46,614
To you, Mr. Pool.

693
00:59:46,623 --> 00:59:51,003
Deadpool. That sounds
like a fuckin' franchise.

694
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:57,224
(Deadpool)

695
00:59:59,248 --> 01:00:01,248
(Deadpool)

696
01:00:03,271 --> 01:00:04,594
(Deadpool)

697
01:00:04,594 --> 01:00:06,594
This shit's gonna
have nuts in it!

698
01:00:07,724 --> 01:00:08,699
They call me Deadpool, I'm hella fast

699
01:00:08,699 --> 01:00:10,699
Where's Francis?

700
01:00:10,724 --> 01:00:12,224
Came to merc the bad guys, and get some ass

701
01:00:12,248 --> 01:00:13,347
Got blades for days, got guns galore

702
01:00:13,371 --> 01:00:15,371
Got combo moves, evades and more

703
01:00:23,224 --> 01:00:25,224
Where is Francis?

704
01:00:25,248 --> 01:00:27,248
Run away, you know that I'll chase

705
01:00:27,271 --> 01:00:28,371
Every bad guy, put them
right in their place

706
01:00:28,396 --> 01:00:30,295
Revenge, im gonna give you a taste

707
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,219
I'm sexy as hell, but I cover my face

708
01:00:32,594 --> 01:00:39,594
Seltzer water and lemon for
blood. Or wear red. Dumbass!

709
01:00:41,224 --> 01:00:45,224
Captain Deadpool (Nah, just Deadpool)

710
01:00:45,248 --> 01:00:47,248
Merc with a mouth, I can't die

711
01:00:47,271 --> 01:00:49,271
One foot in the grave
But I'm still alive

712
01:00:49,295 --> 01:00:51,295
Try to kill me, I'll just revive

713
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,360
Then I'll put another bullet
right between your eyes

714
01:00:57,594 --> 01:00:59,594
Don't make me ask twice.

715
01:01:00,594 --> 01:01:03,594
Where is Francis?

716
01:01:03,695 --> 01:01:08,594
He made me ask twice.
Is the mask muffling my voice?

717
01:01:09,724 --> 01:01:12,224
I'm bout to take you all
to school with guns and knives

718
01:01:12,248 --> 01:01:14,222
(Deadpool)

719
01:01:14,224 --> 01:01:16,224
Where's Francis?

720
01:01:17,748 --> 01:01:19,748
Where's fucking Francis?

721
01:01:27,594 --> 01:01:30,594
You're about to be
killed by a Zamboni!

722
01:01:30,724 --> 01:01:32,724
Where's Francis?

723
01:01:33,594 --> 01:01:38,594
- No, please...
- Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

724
01:01:39,594 --> 01:01:42,594
Little spider-monkey!

725
01:01:44,724 --> 01:01:46,724
Where is...

726
01:01:46,726 --> 01:01:48,726
Francis?

727
01:01:49,594 --> 01:01:50,994
This is confusing!

728
01:01:51,003 --> 01:01:56,603
Is it sexist to hit you, is it more sexist
to not hit you, the line gets real blurry!

729
01:01:56,695 --> 01:01:58,594
Donde esta Francesca?

730
01:01:59,594 --> 01:02:05,594
Tell me where your fucking boss is!
Or you're gonna die! In 5 minutes!

731
01:02:05,724 --> 01:02:07,724
♪ Sexy motherfucka ♪

732
01:02:09,748 --> 01:02:11,748
♪ Sexy motherfucka ♪

733
01:02:32,594 --> 01:02:39,594
Nice to see you, Jared. I'll
take a foot long. Fully loaded.

734
01:02:54,594 --> 01:02:59,445
41 confirmed kills. Now,
it's 89, about to be 90.

735
01:02:59,454 --> 01:03:01,103
Mr. Wilson?

736
01:03:02,594 --> 01:03:07,594
- You're looking very alive.
- Hah! Only on the outside.

737
01:03:07,695 --> 01:03:10,594
- This is not going to end...
- This is not gonna end well for you, no.

738
01:03:10,695 --> 01:03:13,594
- Where's your boss?
- I can tell you exactly where...

739
01:03:14,594 --> 01:03:16,490
You'll tell me. But first,

740
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:21,603
you might wanna look away for this.
Now this little piggy went to...

741
01:03:23,344 --> 01:03:25,094
Thank you, Agent Smith.

742
01:03:28,594 --> 01:03:30,594
Taxi!

743
01:03:31,594 --> 01:03:34,594
Hop in! Great day for a ride.

744
01:03:35,594 --> 01:03:37,594
And we all know
how this turned out.

745
01:03:40,594 --> 01:03:42,594
Whoops! You weren't
meant to see that.

746
01:03:49,594 --> 01:03:52,594
There. All caught up.

747
01:04:03,094 --> 01:04:07,094
Sorry! About bleeding
at all your garbage.

748
01:04:12,094 --> 01:04:15,094
Seltzer water and
lemon for blood.

749
01:04:17,094 --> 01:04:19,695
Some kinds of anger
can't be managed.

750
01:04:19,795 --> 01:04:23,786
Like the kind where your year-long
plan ends with the wrong guy

751
01:04:23,795 --> 01:04:25,103
getting dismembered!

752
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:30,094
That said, when it comes time to licking
wounds, there's no place like home.

753
01:05:08,594 --> 01:05:10,594
Morning, sleepyhead.

754
01:05:11,594 --> 01:05:16,295
- It smells like old lady pants in here.
- Yes I'm old, I wear pants.

755
01:05:16,394 --> 01:05:19,594
But you're no lady.
Oh, so comfy.

756
01:05:21,594 --> 01:05:24,036
Upside of being blind, I've
never seen you in crocs.

757
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:26,302
You mean my big, rubber,
masturbating shoes?

758
01:05:26,394 --> 01:05:32,594
Yes I know. Downside of being blind,
I hear everything in this duplex.

759
01:05:34,494 --> 01:05:37,594
- Sit on a stick.
- Bactine?

760
01:05:38,594 --> 01:05:40,594
Bactine should do it.

761
01:05:41,594 --> 01:05:46,594
How's that () coming along? Ikea
doesn't assemble itself, you know.

762
01:05:46,695 --> 01:05:51,592
You're telling me. I don't mind the ().
It's an improvement on the Hurdal.

763
01:05:51,594 --> 01:05:54,195
Anything's an improvement over the Hurdal.

764
01:05:54,594 --> 01:05:57,594
I'd taken an Hemnes or
a Trysil over the Hurdal.

765
01:05:59,594 --> 01:06:01,394
No, I didn't get
excited 'till I saw ().

766
01:06:01,594 --> 01:06:02,554
Screw, please.

767
01:06:02,563 --> 01:06:05,402
Here? Now? Just kidding. I
know it's been decades.

768
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:08,594
- You'd be surprised.
- Pretty grossed out.

769
01:06:09,594 --> 01:06:12,594
Ta... dah...

770
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:21,594
I wish I never heard, of Craigslist.

771
01:06:21,695 --> 01:06:24,706
And I quote, "Looking for roommate,
blind, and likes imperfections.

772
01:06:24,715 --> 01:06:28,302
Must be good with hands." Or would you
rather I build the Ikea and you pay rent?

773
01:06:28,394 --> 01:06:31,594
- Why such a douche this morning?
- Let's recap:

774
01:06:31,695 --> 01:06:36,195
The cock-fizzle that turned me into this
freak slipped through my arms today.

775
01:06:36,295 --> 01:06:37,695
Arm.

776
01:06:37,894 --> 01:06:41,161
Catching him was my only chance to be
hot again, get my super-sexy ex back

777
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:43,302
and prevent this from
happening to someone else.

778
01:06:43,394 --> 01:06:46,324
So yeah, today was about as
much fun as a sandpaper dildo.

779
01:06:48,994 --> 01:06:50,795
? drive-by.

780
01:07:08,295 --> 01:07:11,295
Found out who our
friend in the red suit is.

781
01:07:12,295 --> 01:07:18,295
Fucking Wade Wilson. Suppose I'd wear
a mask, too, if I had a face like that.

782
01:07:18,394 --> 01:07:20,295
I only wish I'd heal the same.

783
01:07:23,894 --> 01:07:27,295
Still, we'll put him out of
our misery. On our terms.

784
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:30,059
Right. And when he heals?

785
01:07:30,068 --> 01:07:34,302
He can't. Not if there's
nothing left of him to heal.

786
01:07:34,394 --> 01:07:39,295
You know, it's funny. I
almost missed the fucker.

787
01:07:40,295 --> 01:07:46,594
I like a challenge. But he's bad
for business. Now let's go find him.

788
01:07:51,295 --> 01:07:52,195
Tylenol PM?

789
01:07:52,204 --> 01:07:55,302
It sticks back where
you stuck the Bactine.

790
01:07:55,394 --> 01:07:58,958
I raided my stash of
wisdom just to take a sec

791
01:07:58,967 --> 01:08:02,302
and I am orbiting fucking
Saturn right now.

792
01:08:04,894 --> 01:08:07,295
But I appreciate the gesture.

793
01:08:08,295 --> 01:08:12,295
Am I crazy? Or is
your hand really small?

794
01:08:12,394 --> 01:08:15,295
About the size of a KFC spork.

795
01:08:16,295 --> 01:08:17,726
I get why you're so pissy,

796
01:08:17,735 --> 01:08:19,819
but your mood's never
gonna brighten

797
01:08:19,828 --> 01:08:22,810
'till you find this woman
and tell her how you feel.

798
01:08:22,895 --> 01:08:25,033
What do I keep telling
you, Mrs. McGoo?

799
01:08:25,042 --> 01:08:28,302
She wouldn't have me. If you
could see me, you'd understand.

800
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:29,652
Looks aren't everything.

801
01:08:29,661 --> 01:08:32,802
Looks are everything! Ever
heard David Beckham speak?

802
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:35,189
It's like he mouth-sexed
a can of helium.

803
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:38,802
You think Ryan Reynolds got this
far on a superior acting method?

804
01:08:38,895 --> 01:08:40,795
- Love is blind, Wade.
- No...

805
01:08:41,295 --> 01:08:43,295
You're blind.

806
01:08:43,395 --> 01:08:46,295
So you're just gonna
lie there and whimper?

807
01:08:46,395 --> 01:08:49,050
No, I'm gonna wait 'till this
arm plows through puberty

808
01:08:49,059 --> 01:08:51,903
and then I'll come up with a
whole, new Christmas day plan.

809
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:57,295
In the meantime, you might wanna leave
the room. I bet it feels huge in this hand.

810
01:08:58,295 --> 01:09:01,295
Go, go, go, go, go...

811
01:09:02,295 --> 01:09:05,322
So the doctor says, the bad news is
you don't have that long to live.

812
01:09:05,331 --> 01:09:07,103
So the patient says,
how long do I have?

813
01:09:07,194 --> 01:09:10,295
The doctor says, five.
The guy says, five what?

814
01:09:10,395 --> 01:09:14,295
The doctor says, 4, 3, 2...

815
01:09:20,295 --> 01:09:22,895
Can I help you ladies?

816
01:09:25,295 --> 01:09:27,295
Oh, I do hope so.

817
01:09:30,295 --> 01:09:35,295
Now, I heard you might be able to point
me in the direction of a, a friend of mine.

818
01:09:35,395 --> 01:09:37,295
Name of Wade Wilson.

819
01:09:38,295 --> 01:09:41,295
Sorry, I don't know the name.

820
01:09:48,295 --> 01:09:51,164
Hey, you're not supposed
to be behind the bar.

821
01:09:54,295 --> 01:09:55,577
I've seen this girl.

822
01:09:55,586 --> 01:09:59,302
This must be Vanessa. I've
heard so much about you.

823
01:10:03,295 --> 01:10:05,430
Sweetheart, you might
wanna look around.

824
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:08,302
This isn't really the place
to do something like that.

825
01:10:09,295 --> 01:10:13,295
Easy, Angel. Put
the little man down.

826
01:10:14,295 --> 01:10:17,295
- We have everything we need now.
- You sure?

827
01:10:18,295 --> 01:10:21,295
You don't want any clothes
that are not monochromatic?

828
01:10:21,395 --> 01:10:24,295
Have fun at your midnight
showing of Blade II.

829
01:10:27,295 --> 01:10:30,295
Thanks for having my back, guys.

830
01:10:34,895 --> 01:10:38,795
Wade, we have a fucking
problem, and by we, I mean you.

831
01:10:39,994 --> 01:10:45,295
I can't believe we're doing this. Is there
a word for half-afraid, half-angry?

832
01:10:45,395 --> 01:10:48,295
"Afrangry", I guess. Have you
decided what you're gonna say to her?

833
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:52,994
- Fuck me!
- Maybe not start with that.

834
01:10:58,295 --> 01:11:04,295
Hey, coming on to our stage
right now, give it up for Chastity!

835
01:11:07,295 --> 01:11:09,222
Or as I like to call her, Irony.

836
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:12,302
I gotta find her fast,
before numb nuts does.

837
01:11:12,395 --> 01:11:17,295
- How do you know she's in here?
- Some customer stalking that fox.

838
01:11:41,295 --> 01:11:45,295
Every time I see her,
it's like the first time.

839
01:11:45,795 --> 01:11:48,295
Especially from this angle.

840
01:12:11,295 --> 01:12:15,295
You can't buy love, but you
can rent it for three minutes.

841
01:12:18,295 --> 01:12:21,295
You weak motherfucker!

842
01:12:22,295 --> 01:12:27,295
C'mon. Get it together, this isn't
about you, this is about Vanessa.

843
01:12:31,295 --> 01:12:33,295
Here we go.

844
01:12:35,295 --> 01:12:37,295
Maximum effort.

845
01:12:40,295 --> 01:12:41,895
Vanessa!

846
01:12:44,295 --> 01:12:50,295
Someone out back asking for you.
Something about, an old boyfriend?

847
01:13:16,295 --> 01:13:21,295
I knew it was you. 'Cause
we're weird curvy edges.

848
01:13:22,295 --> 01:13:24,295
Like a jigsaw puzzle.

849
01:13:34,295 --> 01:13:37,295
You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.

850
01:13:45,295 --> 01:13:46,761
Hey, where did she go?

851
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:50,302
I saw her head to the back.
Go get her, tiger.

852
01:14:17,694 --> 01:14:19,293
Motherfucker!

853
01:14:19,295 --> 01:14:22,095
- Wade, Wade, Wade, Wade...
- Cunt! Chocolate...

854
01:14:22,295 --> 01:14:27,295
- Jiminy... Fuck! Fuck!
- We can talk... or you can hit that...

855
01:14:32,295 --> 01:14:35,293
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Relax, relax. Okay...

856
01:14:35,295 --> 01:14:42,295
I'm gonna rip his motherfucking... find
that, find it, or I'm gonna get angry.

857
01:14:44,295 --> 01:14:48,194
Here, this is Vanessa.
No, wait, it's Francis.

858
01:14:48,295 --> 01:14:51,295
- He wants you to come to him.
- What is that?

859
01:14:51,395 --> 01:14:54,984
That's the shit emoji. It's the turd
with the smiling face and the eyes.

860
01:14:54,993 --> 01:14:57,302
I thought it was chocolate
yogurt for so long.

861
01:14:57,595 --> 01:15:00,295
- I need guns.
- Okay, which ones?

862
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:03,295
- I need all the guns!
- All right, okay.

863
01:15:22,694 --> 01:15:27,694
- That's about 3000 rounds.
- And we all know what I can do with 12.

864
01:15:27,994 --> 01:15:31,295
Hey, hey, careful with that,
Ronnie Milsap, we're downrange.

865
01:15:32,295 --> 01:15:37,295
I was gonna spend the night assembling
the () but this is holding my interest.

866
01:15:37,395 --> 01:15:40,287
- I told you, we're going
with the (), not the (),

867
01:15:40,296 --> 01:15:42,702
get it thru your head
or get outta Fucktown!

868
01:15:42,711 --> 01:15:43,610
Shit.

869
01:15:43,694 --> 01:15:45,365
That's all the
pieces in the house.

870
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:47,603
No, no, no, come on. Let's go.
Cough it up.

871
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:53,295
- Down, down, down, down.
- Fuck you.

872
01:15:54,295 --> 01:15:57,295
45 cal. I like it.

873
01:15:59,194 --> 01:16:00,295
Wade...

874
01:16:01,295 --> 01:16:05,295
I'd go with you, but...
I don't wanna.

875
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:10,295
Oh, listen, Al...

876
01:16:11,295 --> 01:16:16,295
If I never see you again, I want you
to know that I love you very much.

877
01:16:17,295 --> 01:16:18,694
And also,

878
01:16:18,703 --> 01:16:22,332
there's about 116 kilos of cocaine
buried somewhere in the apartment,

879
01:16:22,341 --> 01:16:24,310
right next to the cure for blindness.

880
01:16:24,395 --> 01:16:26,295
Good luck.

881
01:16:30,295 --> 01:16:33,295
You wanna get fucked up?

882
01:16:41,795 --> 01:16:44,295
Put her down over here.

883
01:16:53,295 --> 01:16:55,295
Go on, then.

884
01:16:57,295 --> 01:17:03,295
- Thanks, dickless. And I mean you.
- You're a talker, too. You and Wade.

885
01:17:03,395 --> 01:17:06,733
I've been trying to tell you
assholes you got the wrong girl.

886
01:17:06,742 --> 01:17:08,302
My old boyfriend, he's dead.

887
01:17:08,395 --> 01:17:16,295
See, I thought that, too. But he keeps on
coming back. Like a cockroach, but uglier.

888
01:17:16,395 --> 01:17:23,795
Now, I may not feel, but he does. Let's see
how he fights with your head on the block.

889
01:17:31,295 --> 01:17:35,295
- Ripley! From Alien 3!
- Fuck, you're old.

890
01:17:36,295 --> 01:17:39,845
Fake laugh! Hiding real pain!
Go get Silver balls.

891
01:17:39,854 --> 01:17:43,403
You guys going for a bite?
Early bird special?

892
01:17:43,595 --> 01:17:46,795
Like there's something wrong with eating
before sundown or saving money. No.

893
01:17:46,994 --> 01:17:51,295
You know that bad guy that
you let go? He's got my girl.

894
01:17:52,295 --> 01:17:56,045
- You're gonna help me get her back.
- Wade? Is that you?

895
01:17:56,145 --> 01:18:00,295
Yeah, it's me Deadpool, and I got
an offer that you can't refuse!

896
01:18:02,895 --> 01:18:04,895
I'm gonna wait out here,
okay? It's a big house!

897
01:18:04,994 --> 01:18:07,176
It's funny that I only ever see 2 of you.

898
01:18:07,185 --> 01:18:10,302
It's almost like, the studio
couldn't afford another X-Men.

899
01:18:11,824 --> 01:18:17,125
And that, is why in my opinion, the
movie Cocoon, is pure pornography.

900
01:18:18,125 --> 01:18:22,125
- Who brought this twinkly man?
- Twinkly, but deadly.

901
01:18:22,225 --> 01:18:26,537
My chrome-penised friend back there,
has agreed to do me this solid.

902
01:18:26,546 --> 01:18:30,233
In exchange, I said I would
consider joining his boy band.

903
01:18:30,925 --> 01:18:34,123
- It's not boy band.
- Sure, it's not.

904
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:36,158
So, any luck winning Gita back?

905
01:18:36,167 --> 01:18:38,663
I tried to hold on
tight, Mr. Pool,

906
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:42,140
but Bandu is more craftier
and handsomer than me.

907
01:18:43,225 --> 01:18:46,125
Well, I think you're
pretty darn cute.

908
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:53,125
- Dopinder?
- Hmm?

909
01:18:54,725 --> 01:19:02,725
- What was that?
- That was........ Bandu, in the trunk?

910
01:19:03,925 --> 01:19:07,125
- Ban-who?
- My romantic rival, Bandu.

911
01:19:07,225 --> 01:19:09,984
He's tied up in the trunk.
I'm doing as you said, DP,

912
01:19:09,993 --> 01:19:14,132
I plan to gut him like a tandoori fish
then dump his carcass on Gita's doorstep.

913
01:19:14,225 --> 01:19:19,125
I did not tell him to do that! Absolutely
not! We got lost in translation!

914
01:19:19,225 --> 01:19:23,425
Dopinder, this is no way to win Gita's
heart back! (I'm so proud of you.)

915
01:19:23,524 --> 01:19:26,824
Drop Bandu off safe
and gentle-like. (Kill him.)

916
01:19:26,925 --> 01:19:33,125
And then, win Gita back the old-fashioned
way, with your boyish charm! (Kidnap her.)

917
01:19:34,125 --> 01:19:36,125
He's super dead.

918
01:19:41,125 --> 01:19:45,125
- I presume a crisp high-five?
- For you? Ten!

919
01:19:45,625 --> 01:19:50,125
Okay, guys, let's get out there and make
a difference! (You know what to do.)

920
01:19:51,524 --> 01:19:53,125
Knock 'em dead, pool boy!

921
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:57,725
Time to make the
chimi-fucking-changas.

922
01:19:58,824 --> 01:20:00,854
Not often a dude ruins your face,

923
01:20:00,863 --> 01:20:02,296
skullstomps your sanity,

924
01:20:02,305 --> 01:20:05,237
grabs your future baby mama
and personally sees to 4

925
01:20:05,246 --> 01:20:06,849
of your 5 shittiest moments.

926
01:20:07,725 --> 01:20:12,125
Let's just say it's beginning
to look a lot like Christmas.

Hey, where's your duffel bag?

935
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:56,125
Goddammit! We'll do this the old-
fashioned way. With two swords...

936
01:20:57,225 --> 01:20:58,625
and maximum effort.

937
01:20:58,725 --> 01:21:00,699
Cue the music.

943
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:18,125
Wade Wilson!

944
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:20,193
What's my name?

945
01:21:20,202 --> 01:21:23,233
Ooh, I'mma fucking
spell it out for 'ya.

946
01:21:25,125 --> 01:21:26,125
Go get some.

947
01:21:26,134 --> 01:21:30,132
Superhero landing. She's gonna do
a superhero landing, wait for it!

948
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:37,274
Superhero landing! You know,
that's really hard on your knees.

949
01:21:37,283 --> 01:21:39,132
Totally impractical,
they all do it.

950
01:21:39,225 --> 01:21:43,824
You're a lovely lady but I'm saving myself
for Francis. That's why I brought him.

951
01:21:43,975 --> 01:21:48,125
I'd prefer not to hit a
woman, so please...

952
01:21:54,125 --> 01:21:57,125
I mean, that's
why I brought her?

953
01:21:58,824 --> 01:22:04,125
Oh no. Finish your tweet. Just give us
a second. Here you go. Hash tag it.

954
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:07,125
Go get her, tiger.

955
01:22:14,125 --> 01:22:18,125
I so pity the dude who
pressures her into prom sex.

956
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:20,425
Alright then. Fire!

957
01:22:31,625 --> 01:22:33,314
Finish fucking her the fuck up!

958
01:22:33,524 --> 01:22:35,625
- Language, please.
- Suck a cock!

959
01:23:01,675 --> 01:23:05,425
Look away, child. Look away!

960
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:17,125
- Wait! Wait!
- Cease fire! Cease fire!

961
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:24,125
Fellas, hey, you only work for
that shit-spackled Muppet fart.

962
01:23:24,225 --> 01:23:25,926
So, I'mma give you a chance

963
01:23:25,935 --> 01:23:30,134
for y'all to lay down your firearms
in exchange for preferential,

964
01:23:30,143 --> 01:23:32,240
bordering on gentle, possibly...

965
01:23:33,125 --> 01:23:35,524
even lover-like treatment.

966
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:39,725
Fine! Commando!

967
01:24:51,725 --> 01:24:53,125
Teabag!

968
01:24:56,125 --> 01:24:59,524
- Bob?
- Wade?

969
01:24:59,725 --> 01:25:02,143
Oh my God, I haven't seen
you since, TGIFridays!

970
01:25:02,152 --> 01:25:03,533
Jacksonville. Fridays.

971
01:25:04,125 --> 01:25:08,725
What the hell! God!
Come here, you.

972
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:15,172
How are the kids? Good? And Gail, is
she still fixing that tuna casserole?

973
01:25:15,181 --> 01:25:17,132
It's so good, but bad for...

974
01:25:24,125 --> 01:25:28,881
Your... on the left...
You are beautiful...

975
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:32,132
That is so sweet! Thanks!

976
01:25:43,125 --> 01:25:47,125
Does he write you notes,
too? He's such a romantic.

977
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:49,125
Don't worry, baby. I'm coming.

978
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:51,425
Fire!

979
01:25:58,125 --> 01:26:02,125
Hey! Climb on.

980
01:26:51,125 --> 01:26:55,125
Motherfucker shoulda
worn his brown pants.

981
01:26:56,125 --> 01:27:00,604
You were right, beautiful.
Red really is my color.

982
01:27:00,613 --> 01:27:01,733
Wade?

983
01:27:01,824 --> 01:27:05,774
Don't worry, baby. I'mma
get you outta that shitbox.

984
01:27:05,925 --> 01:27:08,845
What better way to crawl back
inside that head of yours.

985
01:27:08,854 --> 01:27:10,132
Oh, you never left.

986
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:14,125
- But you did, asshole!
- Deep breath, darling.

987
01:27:15,125 --> 01:27:20,125
No wait.... Wrong
choice of words.

988
01:27:21,125 --> 01:27:24,215
Well I hope they've blocked
pain to your every last nerve.

989
01:27:24,224 --> 01:27:25,533
'Cause I'mma go looking!

990
01:27:26,925 --> 01:27:29,402
I hear you grow back
body parts now, Wade.

991
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:32,233
When I'm finished, what's
left to grow back you?

992
01:27:32,375 --> 01:27:36,125
Good one.... Yup.
That was a good one.

993
01:27:36,225 --> 01:27:41,625
Let's dance. And by "dance", I
mean let's try to kill each other.

994
01:28:35,725 --> 01:28:41,125

01:31:07,125 --> 01:31:09,824
I got a plan. You're
not gonna like it.

1011
01:31:19,125 --> 01:31:22,125
Shit, shit, shit!

1012
01:31:26,125 --> 01:31:30,125
Don't worry! I'm
totally on top of this.

1013
01:31:45,125 --> 01:31:50,125
Dammit! Maximum effort!

1014
01:32:32,125 --> 01:32:34,125
Thanks.

1015
01:32:38,125 --> 01:32:41,125
Just take it slow.

1016
01:32:50,524 --> 01:32:53,824
Oh, my God! That was so awe...

1017
01:33:26,524 --> 01:33:31,645
Me and you, are headed
to fix this butter face!

1018
01:33:31,654 --> 01:33:32,932
What?

1019
01:33:34,125 --> 01:33:37,425
You sure are a fucking idiot.

1020
01:33:37,625 --> 01:33:43,725
Did you really think
there was a cure, for that?

1021
01:33:44,125 --> 01:33:48,125
- What?
- You heard me.

1022
01:33:48,225 --> 01:33:51,125
No, no!

1023
01:33:58,125 --> 01:34:06,125
So, you mean to say...
After all this, you can't fix me?

1024
01:34:06,625 --> 01:34:09,324
It sounds even
stupider when you say it.

1025
01:34:09,524 --> 01:34:14,125
Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't
do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for?

1026
01:34:18,125 --> 01:34:20,125
Any last words?

1027
01:34:21,125 --> 01:34:25,125
- What's my name?
- Who fucking cares!

1028
01:34:25,225 --> 01:34:26,725
Wade!

1029
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:31,125
- Four or five moments.
- I'm sorry?

1030
01:34:31,225 --> 01:34:35,127
Four or five moments,
that's all it takes.

1031
01:34:35,136 --> 01:34:36,136
To...?

1032
01:34:36,225 --> 01:34:38,125
Be a hero.

1033
01:34:39,524 --> 01:34:43,524
Everyone thinks it's a full-time job.
Wake up a hero.

1034
01:34:43,533 --> 01:34:47,533
Brush your teeth a hero. Go
to work a hero. Not true.

1035
01:34:49,125 --> 01:34:54,125
Over a lifetime, there are only 4
or 5 moments that really matter.

1036
01:34:54,225 --> 01:34:56,925
Moments when you're
offered a choice.

1037
01:34:57,125 --> 01:35:01,125
To make a sacrifice, conquer
a flaw, save a friend...

1038
01:35:01,625 --> 01:35:05,125
spare an enemy.

1039
01:35:05,225 --> 01:35:10,125
In these moments,
everything else falls away.

1040
01:35:10,225 --> 01:35:15,125
The way the world sees us.
The way we...

1041
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,300
Why?

1042
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:26,300
You were droning on! Sure, I may be
stuck looking like pepperoni flat bread.

1043
01:35:26,399 --> 01:35:29,300
But at least fuck-face
won't heal from that.

1044
01:35:29,399 --> 01:35:31,381
If wearing superhero tights

1045
01:35:31,390 --> 01:35:36,307
means sparing psychopaths then
maybe I wasn't meant to wear them.

1046
01:35:36,399 --> 01:35:40,300
- Not everyone martyred as a hall like you.
- Just promise...

1047
01:35:40,399 --> 01:35:44,300
Yeah, yeah, I'll be on the look
out for the next four moments.

1048
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:48,673
Now if you'll excuse
me, I'm just a boy,

1049
01:35:48,682 --> 01:35:52,877
about to stand in front of
a girl, and tell her...

1050
01:35:52,990 --> 01:35:57,890
- What the fuck am I gonna tell her?
- Well, you better figure it out.

1051
01:35:59,890 --> 01:36:02,621
I can't even tell you... I
deserve that... that too..

1052
01:36:02,630 --> 01:36:04,399
No, no, no, maybe
not the nethers.

1053
01:36:04,690 --> 01:36:06,890
Start talking!

1054
01:36:08,291 --> 01:36:15,490
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. For
everything. I'm sorry for leaving,

1055
01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:18,912
I'm sorry for not
cowboying up sooner...

1056
01:36:18,921 --> 01:36:21,490
It's been a rough
couple of years.

1057
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:22,899
Rough?

1058
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:33,890
I live in a crackhouse.
With a family of 12...

1059
01:36:35,291 --> 01:36:38,811
Every night we spoon for warmth,
everybody fights for Noelle.

1060
01:36:38,820 --> 01:36:39,899
She's the fattest.

1061
01:36:39,990 --> 01:36:45,890
There is nothing that we don't share.
Floor space, dental floss, even condoms.

1062
01:36:53,890 --> 01:36:56,570
So you live in a house?

1063
01:37:04,890 --> 01:37:07,890
I should've come
and found you sooner.

1064
01:37:08,890 --> 01:37:13,890
But everything under this mask,
he ain't the same one you remember.

1065
01:37:17,890 --> 01:37:19,890
You made this mask?

1066
01:37:38,890 --> 01:37:44,190
And this one. In case
the other fell off.

1067
01:37:48,890 --> 01:37:55,890
Like a band-aid. Just... Audi 5000.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1068
01:37:55,990 --> 01:37:57,890
Are you sure?

1069
01:37:58,890 --> 01:38:00,890
I'm sure.

1070
01:38:10,890 --> 01:38:13,890
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1071
01:38:24,689 --> 01:38:29,689
After a brief adjustment period,
and a bunch of drinks..

1072
01:38:29,779 --> 01:38:32,689
It's a face...

1073
01:38:35,788 --> 01:38:38,788
I'd be happy to sit on.

1074
01:38:45,689 --> 01:38:51,244
But I'm not the same
underneath this suit either.

1075
01:38:51,253 --> 01:38:52,697
Super-penis.

1076
01:38:52,788 --> 01:38:56,689
Come on, Wade, language.
Young one is present.

1077
01:38:57,689 --> 01:39:00,494
What are you still doing...
Get outta here,

1078
01:39:00,503 --> 01:39:02,088
go make yourself useful.

1079
01:39:02,088 --> 01:39:04,408
You, go be a really big
brother to someone.

1080
01:39:04,417 --> 01:39:06,796
Tell Beast to stop
shitting on my lawn.

1081
01:39:06,889 --> 01:39:08,666
And you, chicken noodle.

1082
01:39:08,675 --> 01:39:12,596
Nothing Compares 2 U. Sinead
O'Connor, 1990. Sorry.

1083
01:39:12,689 --> 01:39:16,150
That's all right. You're cool.

1084
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:18,896
What in the ass?

1085
01:39:18,988 --> 01:39:21,940
That was not mean!
I'm proud of you!

1086
01:39:21,949 --> 01:39:25,697
We will make an X-Man
of you yet, Wade.

1087
01:39:25,788 --> 01:39:27,329
You know, for a second there,

1088
01:39:27,338 --> 01:39:31,689
it felt like we were 3 mini lion robots
coming together to form one super robot.

1089
01:39:31,689 --> 01:39:34,689
- This was stupid.
- Yeah.

1090
01:39:37,689 --> 01:39:42,689
And now, for the moment
I've all been waiting for.

1091
01:39:45,689 --> 01:39:47,689
Come here.

1092
01:39:56,689 --> 01:40:00,689
WHAM! As promised.

1093
01:40:12,689 --> 01:40:16,689
See? You don't need to be
a superhero to get the girl.

1094
01:40:17,689 --> 01:40:20,689
The right girl will bring
out the hero in you.

1095
01:40:20,788 --> 01:40:24,636
Now, let's finish this epic wide
shot, pull out, here we go...

1096
01:40:24,645 --> 01:40:28,796
Looks nice, not gonna be the only
thing that's pulling out tonight.

1097
01:40:29,088 --> 01:40:31,244
Who doesn't love a
happy ending, huh?

1098
01:40:31,253 --> 01:40:35,337
Until next time, this is your friendly
neighborhood Pool guy singing...

1099
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:37,922
♪ I'm never gonna dance again ♪

1100
01:40:37,923 --> 01:40:40,956
♪ The way I dance with you, oh ♪

1101
01:40:41,564 --> 01:40:44,631
[PLEASE KEEP WATCHING AFTER THE CREDITS.]

1102
01:42:32,485 --> 01:42:34,485
You're still here.

1103
01:42:36,485 --> 01:42:39,786
It's over! Go home!

1104
01:42:41,036 --> 01:42:43,737
Oh, you're expecting a
teaser for Deadpool 2.

1105
01:42:43,746 --> 01:42:46,094
Well, we don't have
that kind of money.

1106
01:42:46,286 --> 01:42:50,043
What were you expecting,
Sam Jackson'll show up?

1107
01:42:50,052 --> 01:42:53,493
Eye patch? Saucy leather number?
Go.

1108
01:42:58,886 --> 01:43:02,484
Oh! But I can tell you one thing
and it's a bit of a secret.

1109
01:43:02,484 --> 01:43:03,770
In the sequel,

1110
01:43:03,779 --> 01:43:06,985
we're gonna have Cable.
Amazing character.

1111
01:43:06,994 --> 01:43:09,993
Bionic arm, time-travel. We
have no idea who to cast yet,

1112
01:43:10,086 --> 01:43:12,586
but it could be anybody. Just
take a big guy with a flat top.

1113
01:43:12,586 --> 01:43:15,320
Could be Mel Gibson, Dolph
Lundgren, Keira Knightley.

1114
01:43:15,329 --> 01:43:17,894
She's got range, who knows?
Anyway, big secret.

1115
01:43:17,985 --> 01:43:19,997
And don't leave your
garbage all laying around.

1116
01:43:20,006 --> 01:43:24,123
It's a total dick move. Go.

1117
01:43:28,832 --> 01:43:31,902
